			There are 4 basic principles and they are repetition, proximity, alignment, and contrast.
		</p>
    <p>
      Contrast is to avoid elements on the page that are merely similar. Contrast was used on my website by having many different colours and having all the colours works together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repetition is to repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece. Repetition was used by having headings be the same colour and the links all be the same colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alignment is where every element has some visual connection with another element of the page. Alignment was used at the bottom where everything is in a relatively straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proximity is where items relating to each other should be grouped close together. Proximity was used when the relative links and the interesting links were grouped up separately.
